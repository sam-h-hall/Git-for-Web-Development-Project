8. What elements can I add an id to?

9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 

    - only once

10. What is a class?

      This is useful when you want to select the child of the parent and only that,
      meaning if you had several elements that were the same as the child element, 
      but some were nested deeper than others, you wouldn't be targetting the 
      grandchild elements, only the child. Hopefully that is clear enough.

Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

    - inline elements don't start new lines, they don't contain other elements, and they don't take up the width
      of the page. Block elements do have those things

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

    - with absolute positioning you are placing the element based on the screen, not based on the other elements
      on the page. So, you can put it wherever you want, it's not affecting or being affected by any other elements'
      position. Basically, to the other elements on the page, it doesn't exist and is free to be put wherever you want.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

    - display: inilne-block

4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    - display block:
        1. <p>
        2. <h1>
        3. <li>
    display inline:
        1. <span>
        2. <emphasis>
    display inline-block:
        1. textarea

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?

    - The box model is a way to give positioning to our HTML elements via CSS. The box model has
      4 parts: the outermost layer is the margin, inside of that is the border, then padding,
      and then our content. 
    
    - The issue with the box model is that padding and borders are put on all of our elements, so
      when we have elements that are close together, we may have issues with overlapping. So, to fix
      this, we just use box-sizing: border-box. This includes padding and borders inside of an elements 
      width. The result is that if we want a width of 100x100px, the 4 elements above are resized to fit that
      requirement.
